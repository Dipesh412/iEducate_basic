            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            Transforming Education in India
        </p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….

We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…

For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
            Parenting has always been a realization and reminiscence of the blissful days of our childhood. During our childhood, our parents made sure that we are more connected to the world and the people around us. While they led our little minds to explore and interact with the world, they gave us the wisdom to find the difference between the right and the wrong. They wanted us to learn from our mistakes and experiences. They gave us the freedom to build our own worlds which were much bigger and unique than today’s generation. Kids learn through experiences and not through words. They imitate what parents do. When their play is restricted, they tend to lean towards the electronic gadgets and start creating their own world of experience around them. Our kids need ‘smarter’ parents, not smartphones. At TGS, we aim to create a bigger world for your kids where they can play and learn to excel in their life and we firmly stand by our tagline “Play, Learn and Grow Together”.
